    "Imagine a (literal) stack of plates. If the stack gets too high, it might topple. Therefore, in real life, we would likely start a new stack when the previous stack exceeds some threshold. Implement a data structure SetOfStacks that mimics this. SetOfStacks should be composed of several stacks, and should create a new stack once the previous one exceeds capacity. SetOfStacks.push() and SetOfStacks.pop() should behave identically to a single stack (that is, pop() should return the same values as it would if there were just a single stack). Implement a function popAt(int index) which performs a pop operation on a specific sub-stack."

    "We know that push() should behave identically to a single stack, which means that we need push() to call push on the last stack. We have to be a bit careful here though: if the last stack is at capacity, we need to create a new stack.\n",

    "NOTE: You could make an argument that, rather than “rolling over,” we should be OK with some stacks not being at full capacity. This would improve the time complexity (by a fair amount, with a large number of elements), but it might get us into tricky situations later on if someone assumes that all stacks (other than the last) operate at full capacity. There’s no “right answer” here; discuss this trade-off with your interviewer!"
